# Pest-and-Disease-Control

### Problem Statement 
There are many types of manual pesticide spraying machines available but the existing solutions are slightly expensive, consume a lot of time, and manual labor to complete the task. The farmer needs a way to automate the process of identifying pests on the infected crops and spraying appropriate quantities of pesticides so that manual spraying of pesticide is avoided and the health of the crop is maintained.

### Goals and Objectives 
1. To build a real time AI based pest controller
2. To build a  system which is portable and easy to mount
3. Maximize crop production with minimal input costs
4. To build a real-time solution for local farmers
5. To avoid manual spraying of pesticides
6. Technologies which are AI-based help in improving efficiency in the fields of the  agricultural sector
7. To design such a mechanism in which spraying and managing parameters like area  of spraying, deliver a pesticide spraying tank on it and pass across the fields

### Proposed System 
The proposed system concentrates on an automation pest detection, its infestation levels and rightly sprays the required quantity of pesticides. This also allows for an early pest detection as the system is trained for two major classes of pest infestation found in the POTATO plant namely, EARLY BLIGHT and LATE BLIGHT, and HEALTHY leaves of the crop. There are a number of techniques which can be employed to identify the pests causing plant diseases. The pest detection is carried out using Raspberry Pi. This feature makes the device innovative as it sprays the right amount of pesticide according to its level of infestation and the pest detected. The system notifies on the pesticide levels in the container using the coloured LED lights. Furthermore, the system also works on renewable sources of energy by making use of solar panels.

### Result
Successfully desgined and deployed a pesticide spraying robot that detects the pest infestation in potato plants and then sprays pesticide in the required quantity based upon the pest infestation levels. It navigates in the directions as desired by the user. Control for the same happens through a smartphone.
